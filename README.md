# NWChem Compilation

A shell script for auto compile NWChem program on CentOS 6.x &amp; 7.x Linux-based. Don't trust the script but it works for me. However, this script can be adjusted and adaptive for other Linux distribution. 

### Requirement
* NWChem version 6.6 or 6.8 (or previous version)
* CentOS version 6.x or 7.x (or other Linux distro)
* Python version 2.6 or 2.7
* Suitable MPI libraries (e.g. OpenMPI)
* Compiler: Intel, GNU, PGI, etc. More details please consult [NWChem manual](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Compiling_NWChem#Setting_up_the_proper_environment_variables).
### Installation
  * **(1)**  Install required package using command (root or sudo)
```
yum install python-devel gcc-gfortran openblas-devel openblas-serial64 openmpi-devel scalapack-openmpi-devel blacs-openmpi-devel elpa-openmpi-devel tcsh --enablerepo=epel
```
  * **(2)**  Create directory NWCHEM at */usr/local/src/*. Then move to NWCHEM direcotry
```
mkdir /usr/local/src/NWCHEM && cd /usr/local/src/NWCHEM
```
  * **(3)**  Download program source code from [NWChem github](https://github.com/nwchemgit/nwchem) to your Linux machine using **wget** command. The release of NWChem can be found [here](https://github.com/nwchemgit/nwchem/releases/tag/v6.8-release). I downloaded the NWChem 6.8 using command
```
wget https://github.com/nwchemgit/nwchem/releases/download/v6.8-release/nwchem-6.8-release.revision-v6.8-47-gdf6c956-src.2017-12-14.tar.bz2
```
Extract full source code from *.tar.bz2* file using command. Then you should see *nwchem-6.8 directory*.
```
tar -xvjf nwchem-6.8-release.revision-v6.8-47-gdf6c956-src.2017-12-14.tar.bz2
```
  * **(4)**  Download both of [1_compile.sh](https://github.com/rangsimanketkaew/NWChem/blob/master/1_compile.sh) and [2_path.sh](https://github.com/rangsimanketkaew/NWChem/blob/master/2_path.sh) scripts to */usr/local/src/NWCHEM/nwchem-6.8/*.
```
cd /usr/local/src/NWCHEM/nwchem-6.8/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rangsimanketkaew/NWChem/master/1_compile.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rangsimanketkaew/NWChem/master/2_path.sh
```
Run 1_compile.sh using command
```
./1_compile.sh
```
The process will take you about 30 minutes. If no any error message occurs, run script 2_path.sh to generate the nwchem library.
  * **(5)**  Change directory to your *$HOME* and create a **.nwchemrc** file using command.
```
cd $HOME && touch $HOME/.nwchemrc
```
Then append the following commands into .nwchemrc file.  
```
  nwchem_basis_library /usr/local/nwchem/data/libraries/
  nwchem_nwpw_library /usr/local/nwchem/data/libraryps/
  ffield amber
  amber_1 /usr/local/nwchem/data/amber_s/
  amber_2 /usr/local/nwchem/data/amber_q/
  amber_3 /usr/local/nwchem/data/amber_x/
  amber_4 /usr/local/nwchem/data/amber_u/
  spce    /usr/local/nwchem/data/solvents/spce.rst
  charmm_s /usr/local/nwchem/data/charmm_s/
  charmm_x /usr/local/nwchem/data/charmm_x/
```
  * **(6)** Run a sample calculation to check whether NWChem program is installed perfectly. I include [a input file](https://github.com/rangsimanketkaew/NWChem/blob/master/test-azulene-dft/test-azulene.nw) of geometry optimization of azulene using DFT/M06-2X/6-31G(d) in gas phase.
```
nwchem test-azulene.nw >& test-azulene.out &
```
Caveat! Note that the day I posted this script I was using NWChem version 6.6 and 6.8.

---
**Optional: PATH SETTING.** Instead of running nwchem using its absolute path, you can make an aliase of NWChem program by adding the *nwchem* absolute path to $PATH using command
```
export PATH=/usr/local/nwchem-6.6/bin/LINUX/nwchem:$PATH
```
To do this every time you login, each user must permanently append the above command to $PATH in *$HOME/.bashrc* file.
```
echo export PATH=/usr/local/nwchem-6.6/bin/LINUX/nwchem:$PATH >> /home/$USER/.bashrc
```
Then activate the *.bashrc* file
```
source /home/$USER/.bashrc
```
Try to logout and login again, now you can run NWChem via *nwchem*.

# Error & Fixing
1. Error: Cannot open library E.g. *libmpi_f90.so.1: cannot open*.<br />
When: Installing NWChem using **make** or **configuration setting up** command.<br />
Fix: You can fix this error using command
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/openmpi/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
source $HOME/.bashrc
```
  * **(2)** Since you have run NWChem with MPI and suddenly see the following error
```
utilfname: cannot allocate
```
or
```
utilfname: cannot allocate:Received an Error in Communication
```
This error message is telling you that NWChem cannot allocate the memory with number of processors. You must specify the amount of memory **PER** processor core that NWChem can possibly employs for a calculation. <br />
This issue can be easily fixed by *memory* keyword to control the certain memory, for example a following command is used to limit the memory to 1 Gigabyte/process.
```
memory total 1 GB
```
Again, if you run NWChem using command like *"mpirun -np N nwchem INPUT-FILE.nw"*, this means the memory required for this calculation = (1 GB)*(N processors). 
<br />
More details of memory arrangement can be found on [this website](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Release66:Top-level#MEMORY)

 Â * **(3)** Error about MPI libraries. Check the suitable libraries that you can use by command
```
mpif90 -show
```

# Running NWChem
You can try to run nwchem with example file offered by the developer. A ton of input & output files are at **/usr/local/src/NWCHEM/nwchem-6.6/examples/** and **/usr/local/src/NWCHEM/nwchem-6.6/QA/tests**. Running calculation on standalone machine or HPC cluster with OpenMPI parallel using command
```
mpirun -np N nwchem INPUT-FILE.nw >& OUTPUT-FILE.log
```
To run NWChem with multithreaded/OpenMPI, one can use command
```
mpirun -np N -map-by socket -bind-to socket nwchem INPUT-FILE.nw >& OUTPUT-FILE.log
```
The following command may be useful
```
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=M
```
where N and M = number of processors and threads (integer & positive number), respectively. Set number of threads = 1 is recommended if the cluster/machine do not do I/O or even you do not know. This value provides the best performance. You can add optional to set the calculation for either single or multi-threaded process.
```
mpirun -genv OMP_NUM_THREADS M -np N nwchem INPUT-FILE.nw >& OUTPUT-FILE.log 
```
---
Running on MPI Cluster using MPICH
```
mpirun -np $NSLOTS nwchem INPUT-FILE.nw >& OUTPUT-FILE.log 
```
Running on MPI Cluster using MVAPICH2
```
mpirun -genv OMP_NUM_THREADS M -genv MV2_ENABLE_AFFINITY 0 -np N nwchem INPUT-FILE.nw >& OUTPUT-FILE.log 
```
The total number of cpu cores used for this calculation will be M x N.

## OpenMPI 1.6.5 Installation
[Please visit this website](http://lsi.ugr.es/~jmantas/pdp/ayuda/datos/instalaciones/Install_OpenMPI_en.pdf). Not only version 1.6.5, but also other version says 2.x are also used in conjunction with NWChem compilation as long as you set the linkink and compatible libraries correctly.

## OpenBLAS Installation
You may need to install OpenBLAS yourself. Download source file at [Download here](https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.6/) <br />
Explanation of installation is here [Installation guide](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/Installation-Guide).

## More details
I also provide the scripts for compiling of NWChem program (in this repository) on other platform or parallel achitecture. Additionally, If manually compiling of NWChem is too difficult for beginner, one can install (compile) NWChem by another way. I explained how to install NWChem using rpm and yum commands in [this website](https://sites.google.com/site/compchem403/personal-area/linux-knowledge/install-nwchem). The binary rpm file of various flavor of NWChem version 6.6, i.e. nwchem-common, nwchem-openmpi, nwchem-mpich, can be found at [PKGS.org](https://pkgs.org/download/nwchem) and [RPM Find](https://www.rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=nwchem&submit=Search+...). However, it was written in Thai. If you have any problems you can consult the [Q&A forum of NWChem](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Special:AWCforum) or visit [NWChem compilation](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Compiling_NWChem#Setting_up_the_proper_environment_variables).
